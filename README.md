## Scope
The scope of this project is to track every single launch that SpaceX has ever made.

Through the various pages it is possible to view all kinds of data and informations about every single launch.

The way this client sided app works is simple, it retrieves data through an API service that provides everything and then shows it in a readable format (a web page).


## Software used
Front-end: ```Angular 8.2.14```  
API Server: [SpaceX API Repository](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/blob/master/docs/v4/)
